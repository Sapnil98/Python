# Python

This is a sample program that I wrote using the not so popular Face_recognition library that is available as a package for python.
The Face_recogniton library uses dlib.

### Dlib
Dlib has a face recognition function which maps a face into 128 different points. These 128 points can then be compared to the points of another face.The dlib library uses a pre defined model to map the faces to the points.
